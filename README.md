# SP-FireBase
In this application, I am asking users to input train details. As the user enter the train details, I am creating a train object and pushing the object. 
When my firebase has a new child added, I created a call back function to take snapshot of the data entered and getting the values of trains. 
In the next step, I am displaying train details in the table at top. 

To-Do:
Add Edit and Delete button to each train row and when Edit button is clicked, I will display a modal with all train details populated in text box. then user can make changes and save them. 
When user click Delete button, I will delete the object associated with the row from the database.
